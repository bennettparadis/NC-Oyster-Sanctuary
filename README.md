# NC-Oyster-Sanctuary
R scripts used to analyze data collected from monitoring NC's network of oyster sanctuaries

General Description						February 22, 2023

North Carolina’s Division of Marine Fisheries has been permitting, constructing, and monitoring oyster sanctuaries since the late 1990s, following a recommendation from the 1995 Blue-Ribbon Advisory Council on Oysters to rehabilitate eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations in North Carolina. In pursuit of this goal, NCDMF created Program 611 in order to monitor the effectiveness of the creation and preservation of protected artificial oyster reef habitat within the Pamlico Sound Oyster Sanctuary Network. In an annual effort, SCUBA certified biologists and technicians conduct quantitative surveys on each oyster sanctuary, collecting data on the density and population structure of oysters at each site, as well as other species present and relevant abiotic data.

The creation and preservation of oyster sanctuaries represents both a long-term ecological restoration project as well as a long-term fisheries investment to the state of North Carolina. While artificial reefs and oyster sanctuaries can be relatively small in comparison to natural reefs, they provide ecosystem services that improve the quality of habitat throughout Pamlico Sound. These benefits include providing nursery habitat for other species, increasing their abundance for commercial and recreational fishing; providing refuge and forage habitat for marine life; providing travel corridors for transient finfish; and increasing water filtration, reducing turbidity and excess nutrients in the estuary. 

Today DMF maintains and manages 15 oyster sanctuaries throughout Pamlico Sound. The sanctuaries encompass 566.22 acres total, with over 223,643 tons of material deployed for oyster habitat (Table 1). Data indicating the degree of sanctuary persistence, in conjunction with data collected from Program 611 (Oyster Sanctuary Evaluations), are then used to refine site selection and construction methods for future sanctuary sites and habitat enhancement. 

Objectives
1.	Evaluate material performance as oyster habitat.
2.	Evaluate material long-term durability and stability.
3.	Evaluate overall material performance for reproductive potential and larval recruitment.
4.	Evaluate oyster demographic trends at each sanctuary over time.






Background Information

The 1995 Blue Ribbon Advisory Council on Oysters highlighted the importance of an initiative to rehabilitate North Carolina’s oyster population. Subsequently, NCDMF’s Artificial Reef Program and Shellfish Rehabilitation Program began this effort with construction of artificial habitat with the intent of creating protected oyster broodstock habitat. The Oyster Sanctuary program is managed by the Habitat Enhancement section of the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF). To date, the NCDMF has created 14 “active” Oyster Sanctuaries (OS) in North Carolinas’ estuaries (Figure 1). These reefs serve to enhance North Carolina’s oyster populations. Prohibited from oyster harvest, sanctuaries encourage the growth of large, healthy oyster populations that act as brood stock for the rest of North Carolina’s waters. This strategy has been found to support high reproductive potential within sanctuaries, thereby providing larvae to natural reefs. In addition to attracting oyster larvae, sanctuaries also act as refuge and habitat for juvenile finfish, crabs, and clams. 

Sanctuary monitoring did not occur until several years following the construction of the first 3 sanctuaries. Recruitment surveys were conducted in a qualitative manner, though it is not clear to what extend monitoring occurred or for how long. Recruitment success at the time was considered to be below expectations and a more formal monitoring program was proposed. However, due to staff and funding limitations from 2000-2005, several years lapsed without any additional inspection or sanctuary sampling. A standard operating procedure (SOP) was successfully developed and implemented from 2007 to 2014. Abiotic data such as material type, mound height, rock dimension, and were measured and recorded as well as biological data including oyster counts, size, and frequency. 
In 2015, sampling was placed on hold to re-evaluate the sampling protocol to provide a better evaluation of spatial coverage and begin standardizing sampling efforts across mollusk assessment programs. A pilot study was generated and in 2018, attempts were made to begin sampling. However, due to hurricane Florence, little sampling actually occurred. In 2019, the first sampling occurred for all oyster sanctuaries still within the network. Sampling was repeated in 2020 successfully across all sanctuaries. This sampling regime was continued through 2023, however, minor changes and additions were implemented to add greater resolution to the collected biological data. The information from monitoring efforts will be used to refine the methods for future sanctuary site selection and construction to achieve maximum ecological value.



Overview of Sampling Design

Performance measurements of oyster sanctuaries will be assessed within the context of the following questions: 
(1) Is the sanctuary meeting its intended function as a persistent source of oyster    larvae? 
(2) Is the material stable and durable over time?
(3) Do some materials perform better over time than others for oyster recruitment and survivorship.
(4) Is there evidence that the reef is providing additional habitat to other marine organisms?

Developing standardized monitoring metrics that address these four questions is critical for assessing the performance and persistence of constructed oyster sanctuaries. Below is a brief over view of the techniques used for addressing each objective. 

Oyster Density and Size Frequencies

One of the most effective ways to assess oyster reef performance is through estimates of oyster density and size frequencies (Baggett et al. 2015). Live oyster density is the number of live oysters, including recruits, per a given area and provides information about oyster population size and annual persistence on constructed reefs. Size frequency is the distribution of oyster size classes in a given sampled area and provides information about oyster population demographics, recruitment, and survivorship. The size frequency distribution of an oyster population is determined by measuring the length (lower valve length, mm) of each individual oyster within a collected sample. Reproductive fecundity and reproductive potential can be key determinants of distribution and abundance patterns of early juvenile recruits (Hughes et al. 2000). This information will 1) provide critical insight into each sanctuary’s recruitment pattern, survivorship, and size structure, and 2) capture any changes or trends that may be occurring through time.

Material Durability and Persistence

Evaluating the long-term performance of sanctuary materials will determine those best suited for environments varied in both salinity and substrate. Constructed reefs using shell can persist if heavily colonized by oysters, and oyster growth and recruitment rates exceed mortality and shell degradation. However, constructed shell reefs rapidly degrade if not heavily colonized by oysters (Powell et al. 2006). While many materials have been used for reefs, a current trend is towards more engineered approaches as opposed to shell. While these engineered approaches tend to be more expensive, there is a lack of data to assess whether these extra costs result in reef longevity and enhanced provisions of the reef. Advantages of alternative materials include their long-term persistence in both fresh and saltwater environments. The assessment of long-term material persistence will be determined using both in-field inspections (sedimentation severity, material presence, etc.) and side-scan sonar imagery time series. The continuation of using side-scan imagery to map sanctuary footprints can be used to quantify growth or degradation rates over time through repeated measures of material footprint, elevation, and rugosity. However, the specific methodology used for this assessment is part of NCDMF’s artificial reef program and therefore is not captured in this protocol. 

Biotic and Abiotic Observations

In addition to evaluating the demographics of oyster populations at each sanctuary, several other aspects will also be evaluated to further characterize each sanctuaries function as ancillary habitat. For example, species of vertebrates and invertebrates that both prey upon and compete for space with oysters can negatively affect restoration efforts. Documenting predator species (gastropods, crabs, flatworms) and sessile organisms (bryozoans, mussels, barnacles) that may impact oyster populations will help determine both future material selections and monitoring techniques. 

Increased sedimentation can also negatively affect oyster restoration efforts due to sediments clogging oyster filtering structures, re-suspending and burying newly settled oyster larvae and covering substrates, preventing attachment by adult oysters (Dame 1996). If bottom habitats are disturbed by nearby dredging and/or boating activities, nutrients and sediments may be placed back into the water column causing increased turbidity levels and oxygen depletion. Evaluating sedimentation will aid in determining both the need for vertical relief of sanctuaries and site selection of future constructions with regards to increased sedimentation due to human disturbances. 

Finally, it is well known that water quality plays a driving role in shaping a reef’s community structure and success as an oyster sanctuary. Dissolved oxygen and salinity, in particular, have been shown by several studies to play a vital role in successful oyster settlement, growth, and survival (Baker and Mann 1992, Lenihan 1999). As such, each sampling event will collect both atmospheric and water quality parameters which will be combined with other water quality sampling to provide context for sanctuary performance.

Sample Workup

Random Site Selection

Due to the logistical and financial feasibility of large scale monitoring, attempts have been made to keep sample replicates to a minimum while still maintaining statistical validity. The survey sample size for each sanctuary is defined by a representative sample that accurately reflects the total amount of each material within a sanctuary. Using the most recent side-scan imagery for each sanctuary, deployed material is digitized in ArcGIS to identify true footprint acreage of each material patch. These material patches are then grouped by material type (Table 1). 

Using the random point-generating tool within the ArcGIS toolbox, n randomly selected sampling points are generated based on the total area of each grouped material layer, labeled, and displayed on a field sampling map (Table 2, Table 3, Figure 2). Each site will act as a replicate for the material type sampled. Additionally, sampling points should also be exported as a .gpx file, and uploaded on the vessel chart plotter prior to sampling. 

Field Operations

Sample types

For investigating the performance of sanctuary sites, there are two types of procedures followed for data collection: observational and excavated. The procedure to be followed at a site is determined primarily by the material type—can the material be excavated easily? If material and the settled oysters can be dug up easily by divers using only their hands, then divers will follow the procedure for excavation. If the material is too large to fit in baskets and cannot easily be removed, then the divers will follow an observational approach. These procedures are described in detail below.
Methodology for all sample types (both observational and excavated)

Upon arrival, discrete environmental and habitat data are measured and recorded. These parameters include: date, site name, material type, weather description, surface and bottom temperature (°C), surface and bottom salinity (ppt), surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L), secchi depth (cm), wind speed (knots), wind direction, latitude, and longitude. Once parameters have been recorded, marker buoys attached to a weighted anchor and an adequate scope of line are then deployed at each of the sampling locations at a given sanctuary. SCUBA divers with PVC quadrat(s) in hand will descend down the marker buoy line to the anchor on the bottom in place of the anchor on the site to be investigated. 

Percent area coverage of oysters, mussel, and algae are collected for both excavated and observational sampling. For sites that will be excavated, this procedure is done underwater, prior to removing any material. SCUBA divers will place a quadrat frame with a 6 by 6 grid formed by 5 strings vertically and 5 strings horizontally (Figure 3). The intersection of lines, nodes, within the grid are used for percent cover estimates. If an oyster, mussel, or algae are present at/under the node of the grid, then that is considered presence. The presence/absence of oysters, mussel, and algae is recorded for each, and noted in situ underwater prior to excavating. At the surface, this number is then multiplied by four to get a percent area coverage estimate on the data sheet (Figure 4; Figure 5). 

Additionally, for both excavated and non-excavated sites, divers will record a categorical boring sponge rating (1=absent, 2=evidence of sponge (boring), 3=sponge present in beta (encrusting), 4=prolific sponge cover (massive).  Sediment type and rating (1=none if no sediment is found either visually or collected by finger sweep), (2=light if sample shows visual evidence of sediment, but findings are only enough to collect discoloration at finger tips), (3=medium if sample shows visual evidence of sediment and findings are less than ¼ inch or thick layers of sediment on sample), (4=heavy if sample shows clear visual evidence of sediment and findings of 0.25 inch or thicker layer sediment on sample) is recorded as well. 
Divers should also take note of any finfish or invertebrates that they might see during their dive on each site and record that in the notes on the respective data sheet (Table 5). 
Excavated sample site procedure 

After acquiring percent coverage estimates, divers with place an open 0.25 m² quadrat frame in the same general location where the grid PVC quadrate was placed. Divers will then gather material within each quadrat, excavating down to 15 cm (about the length of a hand) and placed into a submerged bushel basket. If a piece of material is on the boundary of the PVC quadrat—that is partly within the frame and partly outside—an attempt to excavate the piece of material should be made within reason. If the material is cemented in place or too large for the basket, then it does not need to be included. The material within the quadrat is the priority. Once the material has been placed in the basket, it is then hauled to the surface, brought aboard the vessel, and labeled for subsequent evaluation. 

On board the research vessel, each piece of excavated material is visually inspected and all live oysters measured (LVL, mm) and recorded for a given basket (Figure 4). Here boring sponge data can be recorded as well if not already done so underwater. If an oyster is thought to be dead (hollow and missing the meat; aka a “box”), then it should be measured and recorded at the bottom of the data sheet (Figure 4). Once measurements and counts have been taken, both oysters and material are then returned back onto the sanctuary. 

Analysis - Oyster Density Estimates, Size Frequency Plots, and Modal Analysis 

Total mean oyster densities and standard deviations for each sanctuary are calculated using oyster counts captured from all excavated sample 0.25m2 quadrats. Legal (>75mm), sub-legal (75mm ≥ x > 25mm), and recruit (≤ 25mm) mean densities will also be calculated for each sanctuary. For each mean oyster density comparison (total, legal, recruit), a one-way ANOVA will be used to test for differences between sanctuaries. Post hoc pairwise comparisons will also be performed on any significant effects.

Oyster lengths measured at each sanctuary will be separated into 5mm size class intervals, standardized by area (m2), and their counts plotted. Modal mean ± SD, length, and density (N/m2) estimates will also also calculated from size frequencies for multi-year visual trend comparisons and cohort identification. Modes in each annual size frequency distribution were identified using NORMSEP (FiSAT; Puckett et al. 2012). The number of distributions (i.e., modes) was specified a priori at one and increased in number until the separation index of modal means was <2 (∼2 SD; Jennings et al. 2001 and references therein). Each mode is assumed to represent a distinct cohort of oysters. A cumulative mode derived from each cohort mode is generated based on each cohort mode and provides a linearized representation of each sanctuaries oyster demographics. 

Material Comparisons
Material performance comparisons will take place for data collected within each sanctuary. For excavated material, mean oyster densities (total, legal, recruit) for each material type will be compared using a parametric one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis, depending on whether or not the data meets parametric assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance. Data collected from material evaluations using observational metrics (reef balls, large concrete, etc.) will be combined and graphically depicted.
